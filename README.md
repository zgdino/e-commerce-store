## Notes

#### Alternative fix

.env file in the root
FAST_REFRESH=FALSE

## Hot reloading fix 

- change the version of react  beacuse the latest 17 has problems with automatic reloads when using context hook
- if using react 18 in the future, check the versions for automatic reload

## Auth0 reminder

- react version 16 has problems loading icons for social media sign in
- switch to version 17 or later for a fix
- for documentation regarding react apps search: "react SDK" under Documentation(top right corner)
